Hey there, I am Arun Govil, a hobbyist developer and designer with love for minimalist design and meaningful experience.

Currently fixing bugs at my [workplace](https://www.strebentechnik.com), where I'm actively involved in frontend development using frameworks like [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/), [NuxtJs](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). In my free time I love building side [projects](/projects) and exploring new technologies.

For most of my design work, I use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/).

Apart from coding, I love to sleep, read and explore all new interesting stuff going around the world so as to keep myself up to date.
