Hey there, I am Arun Govil, a hobbyist developer and designer with love for minimalist design and delightful experience.

Currently fixing bugs at my [workplace](https://www.strebentechnik.com), where I'm actively involved in frontend development using frameworks like ReactJs, VueJs and React Native. In my free time I love building side [projects](/projects) and exploring new technologies.

 For most of my design work, I use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/).

Apart from coding, I love to sleep, read and explore all the interesting stuff going around the world so as to keep my worldview up to date.
